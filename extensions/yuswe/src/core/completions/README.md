### Completions (Not maintained)

This part of the extension is not maintained at all and we have to spend more time
and energy to make this work.
Today its heavily derived from the work which Cody did around an year ago to make
completions work (along with the codestory niceness like type-identifiers etc sprinkled
on top).
Use this with caution and if you are interested in revamping this part please Open an Issue
and let us know!
