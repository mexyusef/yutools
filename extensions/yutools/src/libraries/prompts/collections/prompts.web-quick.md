Act as a senior full-stack developer focused on rapid, high-quality code delivery. Generate the following:

STAGE 1: WEB APP CONCEPT
Generate one practical web application idea that:
- Can be built with modern web frameworks
- Has clear, well-defined features
- Uses common design patterns
- Has realistic data models
- Requires both frontend and backend implementation

Provide brief:
- Core features list
- Main user flows
- Data model overview
- Key technical challenges

STAGE 2: CODE GENERATION SPECIFICATION
Create a detailed prompt for code generation that focuses on:

1. Frontend Architecture:
   - Framework (preferably React/Next.js + TypeScript)
   - State management approach
   - Key libraries and utilities
   - Folder structure
   - Component hierarchy
   - Type definitions
   - API integration patterns
   - Common hooks and utilities

2. Backend Architecture:
   - Framework (preferably Node.js/NestJS + TypeScript)
   - API structure
   - Middleware setup
   - Database access patterns
   - Service layer organization
   - Type definitions
   - Error handling patterns
   - Common utilities

3. Data Layer:
   - Database schema
   - ORM models
   - Migration structure
   - Query patterns
   - Data validation rules
   - Type definitions

4. Core Features Implementation:
   For each feature, specify:
   - Component structure
   - State management
   - API endpoints
   - Data flow
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Type safety
   - Reusable parts

5. Common Utilities:
   - API client setup
   - Form handling
   - Data validation
   - Date/time handling
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Authentication flow
   - Common hooks

6. Type Definitions:
   - API interfaces
   - Request/Response types
   - Model interfaces
   - State interfaces
   - Component props
   - Utility types
   - Enum definitions

7. Component Library:
   - UI component structure
   - Shared components
   - Layout components
   - Form components
   - Table/list components
   - Modal/dialog components
   - Loading components
   - Error components

8. Styling Architecture:
   - CSS approach (Tailwind/CSS Modules)
   - Theme configuration
   - Common styles
   - Layout patterns
   - Responsive patterns
   - Animation utilities

9. API Layer:
   - Endpoint structure
   - Request/response handling
   - Error handling
   - Authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Caching patterns
   - Data transformation

10. Data Flow Patterns:
    - State updates
    - Cache management
    - Real-time updates
    - Optimistic updates
    - Error recovery
    - Loading states
    - Form submission
    - Data validation

For code generation, ensure:
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Type safety throughout
- Proper error handling

- Modular architecture
- Reusable components and utilities
- Scalable patterns
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices in code
- Modern ES6+ features
- Async/await patterns
- Proper dependency injection
- Smart component composition
- Efficient state management

Code output should prioritize:
- Functional completeness
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Performance
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Security
- Modern patterns

Generate code with:
- Clear file structure
- Consistent formatting
- Proper imports/exports
- Complete type definitions
- Error boundary setup
- Loading state handling
- API integration
- State management
- Form handling
- Data validation
- Route protection
- Auth integration

Include practical implementations of:
- Custom hooks
- Higher-order components
