4. **Project and Task Management:**
   - Create, edit, and delete projects, sprints, and tasks.
   - Assign tasks to users and set priorities.

5. **File Management:**
   - Upload, organize, and share files related to projects.
   - Version control for files.

6. **Time Tracking and Reporting:**
   - Track the time spent on tasks and generate reports.
   - Visualize data through charts and graphs.

7. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Assign resources to projects based on availability.
   - Track resource usage.

8. **Notification System:**
   - Email/SMS notifications for task deadlines, project updates, and more.
   - In-app notifications for urgent tasks.

9. **Customizable Dashboards:**
   - Users can customize their dashboard to view relevant information.
   - Use of widgets for quick access to key data.

10. **Search and filter functionality:**
    - Advanced search across projects, tasks, and user data.
    - Filter functionality based on project status, user roles, and other parameters.

- **Database Indexing:** Index foreign keys, frequently queried fields, and fields used in sorting.
- **Query Optimization:** Use query batching and pagination for large datasets.

### 8. Development Standards

- **Code Organization:** Organize code into 4 folders (components, containers, assets, services).
- **Naming Conventions:** Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components.
- **Testing Requirements:** Write unit tests for every component and integration tests for API endpoints.
- **Documentation Standards:** Use JSDoc and Storybook for documenting code and components.
